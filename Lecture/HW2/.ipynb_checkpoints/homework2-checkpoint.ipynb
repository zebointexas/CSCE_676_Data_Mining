    "- **100 points [10% of your final grade]**\n",
    "- **Due Saturday, October 19 by 11:59pm**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals of this homework:** There are five objectives of this homework: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Become familiar with Apache Spark and working in a distributed environment in the cloud\n",
    "* Get hands-on experience designing and running a simple MapReduce data transformation job\n",
    "* Get hands-on experience using Spark built-in functions; namely, LDA and PageRank\n",
    "* Design a Pregel algorithm to find tree depth in a network\n",
    "* Understand and implement Trawling algorithm to find user communities\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission instructions:* You should post your notebook to ecampus (look for the homework 2 assignment there). Name your submission **your-uin_hw2.ipynb**, so for example, my submission would be something like **555001234_hw2.ipynb**. Your notebook should be fully executed when you submit ... so run all the cells for us so we can see the output, then submit that. Follow the AWS guide to create a Hadoop/Spark cluster and create an empty Notebook. Copy all the cells in this notebook to the AWS notebook and continue working on your notebook in AWS. When you are done, download your notebook from AWS (navigate to the location on S3 where your notebook is saved and click download) and submit it to ecampus."
