Homework 0 is OUT! Due: September 2 (Monday) by 11:59pm
Howdy 676ers --

 

We have just posted Homework 0 here on Piazza over in the "Resources" tab. There you will find a Jupyter notebook. Instructions below on how to set up your environment. Submission is via ecampus.

 

Due: September 2 (Monday) by 11:59pm

 

Note that this is supposed to be a stress-free homework. For this starter homework, we will only check that you have submitted a notebook with at least some code to ecampus. We will not check for completeness or correctness. Basically, do your best and submit = 100.

We're going to use Python 3.7 (and a bunch of helpful libraries) using Anaconda. Anaconda advertises itself as "the leading open data science platform powered by Python." 

 
Let's start by downloading the latest version of Anaconda: 
 
https://www.continuum.io/downloads
 
Make sure to grab the Python 3.7 version (not the Python 2.7 one). You should find installers for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
 
Once you install, you should find that the path to your python installation looks like:
 
# from a terminal window
>> which python
 
# you'll see something like:
/Users/caverlee/anaconda/bin/python
 
# Create environment for our class
>> conda create --name cs676 python=3.7
 
# see list of our environments
>> conda info --envs
 
# update packages in this environment
>> conda install --name cs676 matplotlib
>> conda install --name cs676 jupyter
>> conda install --name cs676 requests
>> conda install --name cs676 beautifulsoup4
>> conda install --name cs676 seaborn
# plus many others that we'll install later in the semester.
 
# switch over to our new environment before you start coding
# you will see (cs676) now
>> source activate cs676
 
# In Windows, the commands are "activate cs676" and "deactivate"
 
# Use jupyter (newer re-branded version of ipython) like so:
>> jupyter notebook 
 
# Or you can start a blank notebook with:
>> jupyter notebook
 
# then you can save it from the menubar inside jupyter
 
# when you are done and close out jupyter, you can deactivate the current environment
>> source deactivate
# You can find more info on conda here: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/pkgs.html
