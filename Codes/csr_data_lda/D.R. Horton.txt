therefore researcher concluded mean differences groups practically significant perhaps small mean differences shown ttests statistical noise accordingly study failed provide evidence support employees stronger predictor organizational identification individuals working sport organizations individuals working industries base results mean difference tests possible argument proposed researcher initiatives implemented sport organizations receive greater media attention necessarily true reason considered stronger predictor organizational identification individuals working sport organizations another possible explanation results although respondents boundary condition study case responsible efforts lack interest efforts impact organizational identification measurement model order examine

respondents understand social initiatives entail questionnaire provide examples items retained constructs asked organization charities supports measurement perspective items retained constructs worked well respondents differentiate supporting social initiatives supporting variety charity hand could possible respondents aware organization supports variety charity aware social initiatives sending questionnaire different organizations researcher found information different activities organizations engaged hence researcher certain organizations engaged social initiatives went beyond charitable giving order improve perceived measure important future studies provide examples type activities considered social initiatives regarding items perceived firm motivation organization supports different social causes organization benefits cause said possibly respondents think organization enjoyed great benefits supporting charity social cause perceive charity social cause benefit organization important note items removed analysis items remained perceived firm motivation construct fact reliability validity analyses suggested dimension exist important future research items added order improve assessment construct explanation issues related items perceived investment cial could rather simple respondents perceive organization invested great amount money initiatives however issue also related awareness according pickens awareness plays important role perception process means aware amount money organizations invest positive negative perceptions aware amount money organization invests initiatives lead employees perceive organization cares wellbeing society hand drawing premise stakeholder theory freeman argued employees stakeholders accordingly possible greater investment

consumer behavior research found positive relationship perceptions firm results obtained study perhaps issue contributed significant results researcher mainly utilized consumer behavior literature

evidence positive impact organizational identification finding important shows organizations communicate socially responsible efforts thei employees employees perceive efforts altruistic firmserving regarding third fourth hypotheses study author proposed positive significant relationship organizational identification ocbs organizational identification results also showed organizational necessary fact empirical evidence supporting relationship showed positive significant relationship variables supports premise employees identify organization behave congruent promotes cooperative environment among employees employees likely cooperative organization engages social responsible behavior promotes type behavior among employees employees likely behave manner results showed organizational identification significant positive effect according ellis includes related actions supported andor sponsored organization study ellis hypothesized owever identification future studies could results

hypothesized moderation effects attitudes toward derivates supported pvalues related four different interaction effect coefficients greater means moderation effect significant table hypothesized moderation effect study made based research conducted fazio williams raden according researchers impact variables perceptions behavior differently therefore argued fication might change according attitude positive negative toward initiatives however empirical results support argument perhaps results influenced fact questions assessed attitudes general statements specific initiatives

literature review provided examine literature pertaining model assessed part dissertation author examined csrrelated literature organizational identification attitudes based literature review research questions provided chapter four different research hypotheses developed reminder following research questions guided study identification employees organizational identification despite recent increase csrrelated research potential impact largely neglected therefore dissertation attempt fill based review literature provided following research hypotheses developed cation trigger emotional attitudinal behavioral responses beneficial organization instance initiatives positive impact employees performance hickman commitment peterson satisfaction devinney identification however extent researchers overlooked indicators comprised concept perceptions behavioral variable study hypothesized perceptions motivation investment comprise overall initiatives indicators drawn literature explained first primary condition needs occur prior examining impact employe according pickens awareness play important role perception process awareness initiatives lead development bilateral psychological contract employees organization ellis morrison robinson well decrease awareness functions boundary condition order proposed relationships among constructs supported figure employees must aware initiatives employer organization engaged mentioned previously initiatives using three indicators perceived motivation perceived perceived investment dissertation motivation related perceived organizational motives engaging initiatives based theory hunt suggested feeling trust toward organization initiatives organization engaged efforts tend increase following negative media exposure werbel wortman employees become skeptic organizations need consider employees perceive efforts initiatives perceived sincere efforts supporting social cause employees likely believe motivation engaging initiatives actual message conveyed care community goldsmith perception trigger emotional response form identification related perceived congruency organization initiatives authors burke logsdon porter kramer suggested initiatives strategically related perceive organization initiatives likely positive attitude toward organization develop sentimental bond organization perceive initiatives sincere basil herr bhattacharya lafferty walker kent investment related perceived amount resources effort time money organization spends toward initiatives management marketing researchers used signaling theory explain recruitment tactics marketing campaigns communication efforts organization sends consumers potential employees signals unobservable organization organizational values organizations engage socially responsible behaviors initiatives employees attempt attach meaning employer behavior attempting make inferences behavior look signals time money effort employer instance employees perceive organization invests amount resources initiatives enough money effort might perceive organization really care social causes purports support contrary amount resources invested perceived high employees might perceive organization care social causes supports external evaluation perspective common organizations evaluated based financial performance social performance well sims amount money spent socially responsible initiatives considered assessing social performance organizations sims organizations perform well financially socially considered socially valuable sims turban greening suggested employees tend find gratifying part organization socially valuable aforementioned following hypothesis derived hypothesis perceptions positively related organizational identification moderating effect toward previously noted attitudes believed enduring evaluative dispositions toward object chisman mason given initiatives considered object employees likely evaluative dispositions attitudes toward initiatives researchers bohner wanke eagly chaiken interested study evaluating object bias related attitude ajzen bohner wanke according pratkanis attitudes function cognitive affect expectations object facilitate encoding information guide inferences beyond information given particular object situation bohner wanke words attitudes form cognitive schema interpretation particular object situation face pickens explained individuals process organisms interpret organize produce meaningful experience individuals confronted situation stimuli attitudes shape strength individuals perceive interpret situation different reality pickens process also known selective perception uence perceptions initiatives example employees tend negative attitude sincere efforts help society terms investment employees perceive initiatives waste time money conversely employees positive attitude toward local community also possible might think organization invest sufficient resources programs example supports argument made researchers attitudes impact variables perceptions behavior differently terms identification might change according attitude positive negative toward initiatives therefore following hypothesis made hypothesis perceptions organizational identification attitude toward becomes positive negative positive relationship perceptions organizational identification becomes stronger weaker organizational identification behavioral outcomes suggested ashforth mael employees identify strongly employer organization beliefs organization likely positive result individuals work organization engages identified organization might tend believe organization produces valuable social outcomes dutton furthermore employees identified organization behave according objectives goals values organization incorporated gautam metaanalysis riketta identified several behavioral outcomes linked organizational identification example found

chapter discussion main purpose present study twofold examine relationship assess relationship following research questions guided study identification organizational identification despite recent increase csrrelated research potential impact largely neglected therefore researcher attempt fill extensive review literature used purpose developing model could tested empirically several statistical analyses conducted test proposed model results tests presented previous chapter although proposed model receive strong statistical support results provided noteworthy information chapter researcher addresses interpretation implications results limitations study directions future research discussion pilot study results purpose pilot study assess reliability scale although items tested past

identified items assessing showed item tototal correlation items ization choice first item simply work study important note ellis developed items based specific organization hence behaviors assessed specific organization reasonable consider organizations sponsored blood drives individuals willing donate blood consequently items utilized suitable studies like present decision utilize item main study wording second item construct changed employer employees deduct donations directly paycheck organizations accordingly wording item changed reflect generic statement like ellis study specific item successful conducting study employees organizations donation payroll deduction option available employees moreover specific items also developed researchers assess types example participating habitat humanity initiatives recycling reading children fact vast number initiatives implemented organizations assessing future studies adapt items developed ellis create items reflect initiatives organizations conducting studies discussion main study results main study conducted purpose assessing construct validity measurement model well examine research hypotheses discussion results main study presented mean difference tests main study samples collected sample composed individuals working nonsport organizations sample composed individuals working sport organizations hantrais suggested conducting comparisons among samples establish empirical evidence supporting whether organizational phenomena explained causes varies organizational context moreover noted previous chapters initiatives implemented sport organizations seem receive greater attention media general public thus researcher attempted test considered stronger predictor organizational identification among individuals working sport organizations individuals working industries conducting mean difference tests ttests results showed tests significant others table problem statistically significant ttests fail tell magnitude difference field hole reason important calculate effect size effect size parameter tells strong mean differences really field hole evident effect sizes factors small table therefore researcher concluded mean differences groups practically significant perhaps small mean differences shown ttests statistical noise accordingly study failed provide evidence support employees stronger predictor organizational identification individuals working sport organizations individuals working industries base results mean difference tests possible argument proposed researcher initiatives implemented sport organizations receive greater media attention necessarily true reason considered stronger predictor organizational identification individuals working sport organizations another possible explanation results although respondents boundary condition study case responsible efforts lack interest efforts impact organizational identification measurement model order examine measurement model subsequently test hypothesized relationships sample split subsets first subset used test measurement model assessing item tototal correlations factor loadings first results became evident items used assess perceived motivation formed different factors instead therefore items divided factors perceived society motivation perceived firm motivation explained chapter perceived motivation items adapted speed thompson barone study assess perceived society serving motives means assess extent employees perceive organization supports social cause without seeking anything return webb mohr contrary measure extent employees perceive initiatives organization simply pursuing self interest words employees perceive ulterior motives engaging increase media exposure webb mohr items adapted stud motivation therefore results study provide evidence suggesting future studies utilize perceived motivation items assessment dimensions perceived motivation societyserving firmserving next step data analysis examine model modifications measurement model necessary problems items problematic items yield poor model four problematic items organizational identification scale specifically items self factor organization feels like personal insul general associated item behavioral involvement factor item sense factor reasons explain items reasons addressed regarding first item self factor noteworthy past studies used identification scale also problems item reason could wording item contains words perceived negative criticizes insult hence reading item respondents confused used

fine lead believe similar sport fans employees also engage birging corfing processes bask organization tend distance organization fails criticism could regarding second item eliminated self factor general associated organization important part self image important remember item created researcher added pilot study conducted therefore possible test item conducting main study although item seem similar organization important reflection different sense image perhaps participants social associations lives important self image rather associated organization example individuals possibly associated family sport team group friends important part self image employee specific organization rather simple perspective used explain reason item behavioral involvement factor participate different activities outside work coworkers work possible individuals socialize coworkers activities outside work hand issue negative impact item sense factor destiny tied destiny organization approximately respondents said working organization less four years consider short period time furthermore economi crisis united states currently facing possible individuals currently working organization lack alternatives however might considering leaving organization find another perceive economy better state problematic items part constructs assess specifically three items assessed

perceived construct item perceived society motivation construct shared problem items focused relationship organization social initiatives involved wording problem phrase social initiatives perhaps respondents understand social initiatives entail questionnaire provide examples items retained constructs asked organization charities supports measurement perspective items retained constructs worked well respondents differentiate supporting social initiatives supporting variety charity hand could possible respondents aware organization supports variety charity aware social initiatives sending questionnaire different organizations researcher found information different activities organizations engaged hence researcher certain organizations engaged social initiatives went beyond charitable giving order improve perceived measure important future studies provide examples type activities considered social initiatives regarding items perceived firm motivation organization supports different social causes organization benefits cause said possibly respondents think organization enjoyed great benefits supporting charity social cause perceive charity social cause benefit organization important note items removed analysis items remained perceived firm motivation construct fact reliability validity analyses suggested dimension exist important future research items added order improve assessment construct explanation issues related items perceived investment cial could rather simple respondents perceive organization invested great amount money initiatives however issue also related awareness according pickens awareness plays important role perception process means aware amount money organizations invest positive negative perceptions aware amount money organization invests initiatives lead employees perceive organization cares wellbeing society hand drawing premise stakeholder theory freeman argued employees stakeholders accordingly possible greater investment actually anger employees perceive organization invests money initiatives enough money employees perhaps reasons organizations avoid communicating amount money invest initiatives consequence employees perceive amount money employer organization invests great deal last items presented measurement issues attitudes behavioral constructs specifically items construct item donate charity link employer ocbs construct possible explanation addressing items problematic included items socially social responsibility beyond making profit perceived suggest priorities profitable organization items retained however specifically organization initiatives place priority list items eliminated demonstrated measurement issues seems respondents think priority list results imply employees think organizations important possible current american economic crisis also affected employees responded items perhaps economy stronger position employees would answered differently however struggling economy employees perceive nowadays organizations face urgent important demands stakeholders agle regarding item construct charity link employer organization explained previous chapter perhaps loading high residual values fact possibly employees necessarily donate charities work possible donate charities necessarily charities link employer organization surprising high residuals explained third chapter researchers found items used study assess ocbs reliable valid hall podsakoff main problem study modification indices showed three items crossloaded items measuring evidence also surprising items different ocbs items assess type behavior according ellis includes social activities created benefit particular group people community involvement community grants donations corporatewide sustainability programs ocbs hand discretionary behaviors directly explicitly recognized organizational reward system organ hence involvement sponsored promoted organization ocbs involvement case three items assess ocbs retained study important recognize however three items removed work contexts future studies ocbs scale developed podsakoff items presented measurement issues removed measurement model provided better data examining measurement model necessary structural model hypothesized relationships could tested structural model fact measurement model provided acceptable data next step examine overall structural model step necessary prior examining research hypotheses based combinational approach model evaluation proposed bentler evident goodness offit indices fell within

might suggest independent variables increase organizational identification decreases however pvalues negative relationship suggested negative path coefficient significant view fact explained chapter consumer behavior research found positive relationship perceptions firm results obtained study perhaps issue contributed significant results researcher mainly utilized consumer behavior literature postulate relationships variables study thinking back literature utilized come conclusion perhaps incorrect assume consumer behavior studies showed consumers felt reacted certain employees think rather simplistic assumption despite nonsignificant results still believe perceived congruency organization initiatives well perceived firm serving motives impact sense connection identification employees organization literature supporting notion organization mission statement values work practices organizational culture activities toward community among others impact organization therefore continues necessary conduct empirical organizational studies examine order build better frameworks applicable organizational contexts believe studies qualitative nature qualitative studies provide insights employees think perceive relation firmserving motivation instance bhattacharya webb mohr suggested consumers perceived good organization initiatives perceive altruistic perceive initiatives sincere efforts help society concept examined qualitative work employees provide indepth information statement organizational values important furthermore employees also serving instead firmserving consequently conducting qualitative studies researchers creating better quantitative measurement tools assess constructs firmserving motivation results obtained relationship ions investment organizational identification also likely assuming consumer employee perceptions mentioned previous chapters first study examined impact perceived investment context organizational behavior regardless nonsignificant results obtained still think perceptions investment impact organizational identification perceive organization invests resources initiatives perceive organization really cares community therefore cares families high correlation found study societyserving motivation investment support contention perception lead sentiments emotional connection organization also impact organizational identification ashforth mael relationship become even stronger individuals highly identified communities possibility community identification positively influence organizational identification perceive organization really cares community hand employees perceive investments waste resources think organization care employees lead bhattacharya potential impact positive fication however studies specially qualitative studies needed develop frameworks applicable internal stakeholders employees regards effect perceived society motivation organizational identification found controlling variables model perceived society motivation significant positive effect organizational identification previous consumer behavior research provided evidence supporting finding speed thompson webb mohr scholars consumer behavior realm posited consumers develop affective emotions toward brands organizations support different social causes without seeking anything return webb mohr words consumers likely identify brands organizations perceived initiatives driven altruistic motives despite findings consumer behavior literature knowledge first study empirically examined dimension finding provides evidence positive impact organizational identification finding important shows organizations communicate socially responsible efforts thei employees employees perceive efforts altruistic firmserving regarding third fourth hypotheses study author proposed positive significant relationship organizational identification ocbs organizational identification results also showed organizational necessary fact empirical evidence supporting relationship showed positive significant relationship variables supports premise employees identify organization behave congruent promotes cooperative environment among employees employees likely cooperative organization engages social responsible behavior promotes type behavior among employees employees likely behave manner results showed organizational identification significant positive effect according ellis includes related actions supported andor sponsored organization study ellis hypothesized owever identification future studies could results

possibility highly identified employees likely engage employees lower level identification moderation effect results moderation analyses different hypothesized careful examination results evident hypothesized moderation effects attitudes toward derivates supported pvalues related four different interaction effect coefficients greater means moderation effect significant table hypothesized moderation effect study made based research conducted fazio williams raden according researchers impact variables perceptions behavior differently therefore argued fication might change according attitude positive negative toward initiatives however empirical results support argument perhaps results influenced fact questions assessed attitudes general statements specific initiatives organizations engaged also possible bias might affected oposed moderation effect based standard deviation construct much variation among respondents therefore moderation effec could affected employees responded questions results could also influenced complicated closer highly correlated relationship perceptions attitudes future studies attempt find attitudes direct impact perceptions moderate perceptions different captured present research contributions study regardless model proposed study receive overwhelming empirical support results still provide significant insights contributions literature practice first even though recent years organizations established visible programs attitudes behaviors study advanced study impact employees furthermore according wolfe within field sport management organizational research studies limited fact sample composed employees working sport organizations used study results obtained contribute advancement subject sport realm second contribution literature study provided evidence suggesting employees sport organizations nonsport sport organizations different even though initiatives implemented sport organizations receive greater attention least study different impact employees sport organizations study provides evidence supporting proposition organizational phenomena explained causes vary organizational context suggestion forward hantrais third contribution study evidence suggesting employees trust reliability based results obtained employees perceive initiatives sincere efforts help society perceptions contribute
