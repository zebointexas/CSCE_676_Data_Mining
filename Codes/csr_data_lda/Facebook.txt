mcwilliams siegel question companies certain branches engaging still mpetitive advantage become important issue agenda companies many companies adopted strategies become much harder companies differentiate companies oducts longer seen higher quality since competitors engage well thus offer products similar quality makes point view somewhat outdated moreover difficulty companies

communication energy companies facebook answer question provided research question dutch energy companies facebook communicate strat egies answered conclusion overall research provided done summarizing results analyzed chapter last part chapter cont ains discussion general findings research connect broader theoretical issues discussed theoretical chapter discussion part chapter divided based corporate communication facebook consumer response communication lastly limitations study discussed recommendation future research provided conclusion master thesis aimed provide answer question dutch energy mpanies communicate strategies facebook three largest energy companies netherlands researched order able reach answer april examined together first comments consumers related messages theoretical chapter became clear communication corporate communication social media winer become important companies consumers results showed communication facebook indeed become important energy companies twenty percent population facebook messages part earch contained communication moreover results provided insight companies communicating strategies facebook different types messages used communication topics encouragement behavior description outcome action approaches analyzed showed energy companies still holding traditional forms communication even though communication moved online thermore second question consumers respond communication energy companies facebook attempted answered analyzing average amounts comments interactivity tone umer response communication compared related communication lastly results interactivity energy companies consumers showed energy companies exploring interactive level social media akes social media useful tool communication jahdi acikdili based conclusions previous chapters cluded answer second question consumers respond communication energy comp anies consumers respond diverse communication tentatively stated consumers respond positive amount positive responses higher amount neutral negative responses differenc percentages small moreover large amount comments analyzed related communication even though comments posted response posts energy companies based average amounts stated consumers responding acti vely communication facebook average amount comments related messages much lower average amount comments related messages come erall conclusion second question consumers responding quite positive communication facebook amount positive comments neutral comments much higher amount negative comments actively engaging communication facebook average amount related communication much lower average amount comments related communication previous chapters concluded communication part answer research question dutch energy companies communicate strategies facebook companies mostly communicate strategies facebook traditional form commu nication mess ages public relations approach fully make opportunity interact consumers moreover topics companies consumers interact often related became clear data alysis companies thus often engaging consumers strategies interacting companies part research mainly focused topic sustainability environment explained overall strategies goals best benefit sustainability well according previous theory would make communication successful although factor would make communication unsuccessful example description outcome action approach description outcome action present many messages present necessary characteristic successful communication accordi previous theory general based previous theory dutch energy companies would considered successful communication ects necessary ommunication successful missing half messages companies always provide consumers description outcome always right approach inter activity limited comes topic energy companies mostly focusing topic matches identity namely sustainability environment also important success communication discussion corporate communication facebook communication social media become important becomes clear fact twenty percent facebook communication population messages ener companies part research related however companies published much lower amount communication companies tells something communication energy companies already discussed previous chapter eneco nuon state sustainability part main strategy found websites unlike companies essent state sustainability part main strategy explain published less communication companies however essent provide information sustainability website even provide information website othe companies seems contradictory fact essent published amount communication facebook could case essent adopt facebook part communication strategy communication considers website suitable communicate however possible explanation many explanations population messages analyzed becomes clear dutch energy companies made part online communication strategies communication used communicated press releases released makes surprising often occurring type message communication facebook message shows even though communication moved social media companies still hold formats communication fact news second often used form commu nication cebook surprising either also traditional form corporate communication however since facebook designed post short compact messages also quite logical traditional forms corporate commun ication transferred social media allow links websites information provided often case types messages fact tentatively concluded even though communication moved online platforms like social media essence communication still based frequent types messages based results research seems fact stated companies gone mainstream communication instead releasing report strategies confirmed communication definitely released often eighty messages contain communication energy companies time period months according mcwilliams siegel engaging gives companies competitive advantage pany however since energy companies regularly publishing communication competitive advantage seems gone fact three companies adopted strategies regularly publish communication shows significant highly relevant corporate communication seems indeed necessary inform consumers efforts regular basis however fact communication lower amount consumer responses seems somewhat contradictory discussed detail already discussed chapter communication usually focused engagement company social cause much asking attention social cause case strategies communication designed benefit company cause real social change explains occurring topic results adoptin sustainable strategies necessary still want enough energy future moreover consumers value sustainability nowadays thus benefits energy companies become sustainable adopt sustainab strategies also believable cause involved energy company case green marketing considered separately discussion consumers often skeptical communicatio benefits efforts company clear pomering quite clear energy companies would invest sustainability decreases chance efforts less skepticism means successful communication fact eneco posted frequently explained fact sustainability part companies moreover eneco sustainable energy supplier three selected companies probably result complete focus sustainability turn also explains post information frequently energy companies already discussed previous chapter amount communication charitysocial issue quite based results stated case less benefits energy companies involved charity social issue involved sustainability andor environment however still benefit effectively communicate involvement thus clear involved charity social cause otherwise consumers skeptical communication effective pomering nuon published communicat charitysocial issue messages clear woul involved example messages tell consumers invest money dark tunnels make save would give constant publicity also published messages involved charities much less clear would involved however research would conducted able something consumers respond messages clear company would involved messages clear goes beyond scope research encouragement behavior considered relation order successful motives behind communication clear companies want consumers consider communica tion trustworthy green marketing encouragement behavior could help convincing consumers hese concepts provide companies involve consumers strategies also explains encouragement behavior often occurs together topic sustainability energy companies want consumers involved sustainable ideas strategies argue consumers mostly interested results action much results reached outcome effort thing consumers check cking steps taken reach result much harder pomering results previous chapter became clear selected companies specifically described outcome action communication consumers consider social impact effort interested results pomering even argue description come action determines effectiveness would mean half total communication population would effective however stated based results alone also goal research effectiveness tell anything energy companies communicating research consumer response would necessary order able conclude whether communication describe results efforts less effective type message often contained description outcome action message shows even though communication moved social media become frequent energy companies still holding communicate strategies even though social media relatively platform fact messages events also often contain descriptions outcome action shows energy companies want convince consumers strategies messages invitations consumers come visit finished project contributed sustainability moreover types messages often described tcome action contained links websi information provided shows even though energy companies adopted facebook communication strategies still need forms online media comm unicate strategies jahdi acikdilli argue approach companies strategies communication believable match corporate identity want communication successful since public relations frequently used approach energy companies part research stated companies approach matches identity every company public relations strategies wever consumers perceive approach makes consumers believe companies engaged benefits proactive approach however also frequently used approach based consumers moreover five different approaches used total communication makes possible state companies consider approach take message philanthropic approach least often used approaches explained fact mere philanthropic approach enough becaus make clear benefits company mögele tropp balance aspects benefits definitely clearly communicated philanthropic approach none benefits communicate means consumers skeptical messages approach pomering moreover energy companies mostly focused sustainability often already clearly benefits limits possibil philanthropic approach similar statement made profit driven approach goes around focused benefits company enough philanthropic aspects effort companies thus mostly succeeded finding balance aspects philanthropic profit driven approach used limited since public relations frequently used approach stated energy companies still traditional approaches communication strategies communication even though moved modern medium however might case suitable approach type communication companies past strategies messages considered trustworthy consumers least considered trustworthy advertisements pomering often occurring type message facebook communication consumers social media information companies products mangold faulds messages provide provide information companies want whether consumers trust consumer interactivity messages remarkable results show average amount comments much lower related communication related communication however explained fact three companies regularly post polls games suggestion consumer competition related data analysis results became clear type messages much responses types messages could stated amount comments means consumers accepting communication without much skepticism statement based fact consumers find social media useful platform discuss companies andor products mangold faulds consumers skeptical facebook medium express skepticism often communication part research discussed detail differences average amount comments different topics sustain charitysocial issue green marketing small significant taken consideration discussion differences messages encourage behavior messages approach relevant already discussed approach influence consumers perceive communication public relations lowest average amount comments could mean approach tract many consumer responses neither positive negative hilanthropic approach much higher average amount responses average still close mean population approach responses example public relations approach could case consumers skeptical proach pomering however could also argue high amount comments positive desirable companies means consum engaging companie messages moreover comments means opportunities interaction consumers help companies consumers engaged fforts strategies mangold faulds also proven results showed direct relation average amount comments direct interaction higher average amount comments related communication higher chance direct interaction company consumers since direct interaction larger part communication argued companies make nication still rather limited already explained previous chapter tone voice comments consumer important consumer responses also something communicated facebook fact almost third comments included sample related content message shows consumers necessarily facebook discuss certain message medium discuss company eral majority comments posts positive although difference percentages neutral negative comments small chapter paragraph results tentatively concluded energy companies communication quite successful moreover confirms fact gies positive tone voice means consumers reacting approval communication fact almost half responses neutral negative shows consumers indeed skeptical suspicious communication consumers respond communication facebook significant impa companies communicate strategies limitations future research limitations study found fact consumer response small part study investigating consumer sponse could help provide much insight communication facebook perceived whether consumers think companies communicating facebook effective useful also tells something energy comp anies communicating strategies moreover could help energy companies develop communication strategies theoretical approach taken research concentrated corporate perspective communica tion consumer perspective communication however research done coding related messages three selected energy companies coding comments consumers results consumers respond communicat limited interviews experiments consumers respond communication would provided sight
