definition corporate social responsibility corporate social responsibility seen response belief traditional business practices inclusive many groups within society affected practices thus corporate social responsibility shifting business decisionmaking process companies companies focus profit first foremost primary focus creating value shareholder companies companies hold socially responsible primary motivation actions companies show significant concern including variety stakeholder groups including limited shareholders also employees communities customers decisionmaking process means longer enough think shortterm creating value shareholder also necessary think longterm creating value harming society whole beckmann pies requires drastic shift traditional business thought process shift requires recognition couple factors must come play seen debate shareholder theory stakeholder theory corporate social responsibility first shift business thought requires recognition resources going redirected generating shareholder value enhancing corporate social responsibility recognition means directing resources projects programs motivated mainly generating large return investment best larger number groups namely stakeholders help company become socially responsible gibson second shift business thought process requires rethinking companies involve public decisions means companies must become drastically open transparent aspects business must occur public ease company claims engaging corporate social responsibility actually says hond onetime effort part company requires permanent shift open inquiries public portions company operates currently involved detomasi companies also must understand enough engage corporate social responsibility closely involved supply chain

approach business means profits creation shareholder value become less important longterm goals making decisions simultaneously good company society becomes priority freeman sense shift thinking takes place business stakeholder theory corporate social responsibility moves business towards much bigger role play society welfare society whole beurden gossling fact welfare society whole prioritized stakeholder theory means business decisionmaking moved simple decision based profit stage decisions legal ethical stage decisions made right thing post first stages simpler stages business decisions based profit decisions based legal grounds fairly simple simply take consideration external framework means internal reflection required make decision first stage whereas third stage decisionmaking requires internal reflection order determine right company third level decisions brings level morality business decisions stakeholder theory argues exist post definition role stakeholder criticisms stakeholder theory could create endless number groups business consult making decision criticism continues case would nearly impossible make decision number groups business would required consult would endless coelho mcclure spry following thinking stands time necessary consultations would completed opportunity create value would taken another company reason numerous scholars found necessary define stakeholder groups paid attention avoid aforementioned criticism stakeholder groups largely defined employees management local community shareholders suppliers customers post defining stakeholder groups categories company better able make decisions timely fashion still keep mind interests groups groups affect affected actions business stakeholder theory argues gives right interests considered businessõ decisionmaking process gibson necessary business recognize stakeholders legitimate right interests considered company decisionmaking process recognizing legitimacy different stakeholder groups company lessens likelihood individuals feel interests opinions represented frederick freeman argues companies must fact prepare recognize legitimacy groups consider opinions

social responsibility jamali requirement honesty transparency order business stakeholders amicable relationship business required engage stakeholders transparent manner stakeholders easily ascertain exactly business transparency adds trust business stakeholders build developing relationship gibson developing relationship stakeholders need know business hiding anything transparency allows stakeholders help decrease external pressures build company compa therefore transparent stakeholders business decreases chances accused greenwashing stakeholders input clearly done transparent

payne raiborn would complete twisting stakeholder theory basis thus stakeholder theory drivers behind companyõs decision begin play major role whether company truly considered socially responsible inclusion driver behind decision important factor business socially responsible primary reason stakeholder theory requires shift motivations management mainly must sort internal drive belief actions

regarding corporate responsibility environment giving government responsibility regulation public good clean water premise government regulate areas environment business infringing ability member society access pubic good thus government implicit responsibility protection environment ensuring business damage environment public deems reasonable responsible husted jesus salazar stakeholder
